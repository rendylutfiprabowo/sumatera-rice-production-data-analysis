# 🌾 Sumatera Rice Production Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes rice production data in Sumatera Island (1993–2020) to understand production trends, compare across provinces, and evaluate environmental factors (rainfall, humidity, temperature) that may influence production outcomes.

## 🔹 Dataset

* File: `Data_Tanaman_Padi_Sumatera_version_1.csv`
* Size: 224 rows × 7 columns
* Columns: Province, Year, Production, Harvested Area, Rainfall, Humidity, Average Temperature

## 🔹 Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Preparation** → check data structure, descriptive statistics, missing values
2. **Data Preprocessing** → categorical encoding, normalization (optional)
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → production trends, province comparison, correlation of environmental factors, productivity analysis
4. **Conclusion & Reporting** → business insights and policy recommendations

## 🔹 Key Insights

* Rice production in Sumatera increased until it peaked in 2017 (\~20.5 million tons), then dropped sharply during 2018–2020.
* **North Sumatera, South Sumatera, and Lampung** are the largest rice-producing provinces.
* **West Sumatera** has the highest productivity (\~5.17 tons/ha).
* Strong correlation between **harvested area and production (r = 0.90)**, while environmental factors showed weak influence.

## 🔹 Conclusion

* Rice production in Sumatera declined significantly after 2017.
* Major production centers are North Sumatera, South Sumatera, and Lampung.
* Land efficiency in West Sumatera can serve as a benchmark for other provinces.
* **Recommendation:** focus on **increasing land productivity** through modern farming technologies and superior rice varieties.
